Hi, I'm @paulmfischer

I'm interested in about anything programming but mostly full-stack web development. I spend most of my professional time in dotnet and any front-end framework but mostly React/Angular. In my personal time I enjoy playing video games, printing things on a 3D printer, trying to make my home smarter with [home-assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core), and reading (mostly sci-fi or fiction).
